        "\n",
        "    A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation that shows the distribution of a dataset based on five summary statistics: the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum.\n",

        "\n",
        "    Random sampling ensures that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. This helps in obtaining a sample that is representative of the population, reducing biases that could occur if sampling were not random.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role in making inferences:\n",
        "\n",
        "Allows us to generalize findings from the sample to the broader population with confidence.\n",

        "\n",
        "Impact on Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
        "In skewed distributions, the mean may not be a good representation of the central tendency due to the influence of outliers. The median often provides a better measure of central tendency.\n",

        "\n",
